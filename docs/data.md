# Data Design and Flow

## Data Design

### User Data
The app uses several data models:
- Outfit data (stored in Isar database)
  - Name
  - Weather conditions (sunny, gloomy, rainy)
  - Associated clothing items
- Clothing Item data
  - Description
  - Color name
  - Hash code for identification
- Weather data
  - Current temperature
  - High temperature
  - Low temperature
  - Weather condition (sunny, gloomy, rainy, slightly cloudy, unknown)

### App State
The app uses Provider pattern for state management with three main providers:
1. PositionProvider
   - Manages user location data
   - Handles GPS updates
   - Provides location context for weather data

2. WeatherProvider
   - Manages weather data with periodic updates (every 70 seconds)
   - Handles weather API integration
   - Provides weather context
   - Implements loading states
   - Manages temperature data (current, high, low)

3. DatabaseProvider
   - Manages outfit data
   - Handles database operations
   - Provides outfit management functionality
   - Implements CRUD operations for outfits and clothing items

## Data Flow

### State Management
The app uses Provider pattern for state management:
- Multiple providers for different concerns
- Reactive UI updates based on state changes
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper disposal of resources (e.g., weather update timer)

### Data Persistence
- Uses Isar database for local storage
- Implements database helper (isar_helper.dart)
- Supports CRUD operations for outfits
- Includes sample data management
- Implements proper transaction handling

### API Integration
- Weather API integration with periodic updates
- Location services integration
- Asynchronous data fetching
- Proper error handling and fallback states

## Database Operations
The app supports:
- Initializing database
- Loading data
- Clearing database
- Adding sample outfits
- Managing outfit data
- Adding/removing clothing items from outfits
- Querying outfits by weather conditions

## Error Handling
The app implements comprehensive error handling across different components:

### Weather API Error Handling
- Catches and handles API request failures
- Provides fallback to unknown weather state
- Implements proper HTTP client cleanup
- Handles null or invalid API responses
- Implements loading states during API calls

### Database Error Handling
- Transaction-based operations for data consistency
- Error handling for database operations
- Proper cleanup of resources
- Fallback mechanisms for failed operations
- Proper handling of empty states

### UI Error Handling
- Loading state management with CircularProgressIndicator
- Error state display with user-friendly messages
- Graceful degradation when data is unavailable
- Empty state handling for no outfits
- Proper state management during filtering

### Location Services Error Handling
- Handles location permission denials
- Manages location service unavailability
- Provides fallback mechanisms
- Proper cleanup of location resources

## Data Security
The app implements several security measures:

### Local Storage Security
- Uses Isar database for secure local storage
- Implements proper data isolation
- Secure file system access through path_provider
- Proper transaction handling for data consistency

### API Security
- Secure API key management
- HTTPS for all API communications
- Proper error handling for API failures
- Rate limiting through periodic updates

### Data Access Control
- Local-only data storage
- No sensitive user data collection
- Proper permission handling for location services
- Secure state management through providers

### Platform Security
- Implements platform-specific security features
- Secure storage of API keys
- Proper permission handling
- Secure state management
- Proper resource cleanup
